## Dust Collector Hose Sorter (6 Slot)

This 6 Slot Sorter is intended for transparent and flexible PVC 50mm ID hoses with a coiled wire.
Tested with 9mm and 308 Win cases.
2 inch hoses should work as well.

Thicker or very stiff hoses are not recommended.

The hoses are connected using eg. 40 - 60 mm hose clamps.
While the sorter itself doesn't support quick detach for the hoses, you can easily mod it using magnets or with quick detach couplers like this one: https://www.printables.com/model/414801-magnetic-coupling-for-50mm-hose
