===Notes=== 
it may be advisable to apply a little epoxy or hot glue if you feel the panel plugs are a little loose. For the mount for the airdrop mosfet, apply hot glue to secure in place from the back on the bigger circle. The 2 mounting  pegs were left long for melting against the board to secure or for applying hot glue.

Camera body has been extended so a microfit can sit in the body. You will need to desolder and replace or shorten and reroute fan wiring so it doesnt go outside the camera body. This will allow you to have a quick disconnect at the camera body with only 1 permanant wire which is the USB wire for the camera. USB can be extended with ext cable OR you can solder the wires directly to the board or source a longer cable from ali.

For the lid,  utilize CS7.1a - Electronics  lid v2
