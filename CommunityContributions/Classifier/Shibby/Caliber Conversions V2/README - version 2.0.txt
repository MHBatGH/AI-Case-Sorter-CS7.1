CS7.1 Caliber Conversions enhanced by Shibby - v2.0 - 11/20/23


Summary of changes from stock CS7.1 conversions

Conversions with "S" (i.e CS7.1s) - resized bearing hole to "19.0" and caliber designations. WARNING -Super tight fit. 
Conversions with "A" (i.e CS7.1a) - resized bearing hole to "19.2" and caliber designations. WARNING - This is a press fit. 
Conversions with "E" (i.e CS7.1e) - Stock bearing hole "19.6" just with caliber designations. Will behave as the standard CS7.1 conversions. 

Summary of changes since initial release (non version designated readme file)- 

Added "s" versions of conversions.

On the wheels, the cal designation will be on the top of the unit. Tubes have a circle sunk into them with designations popping out a touch.

Tubes are all caliber labeled with no letter designation in the naming scheme. Treat them as you would the normal files. 

Tube Varient - Keyed for BF556 feeder adaptors

45GAP conversion created for all 3 people in the world who shoot it. Use 45acp feed tubes with it. Useful for sorting 45GAP from 45ACP in one wheel. Consider interchangeable with standard 45acp wheel. 

These work for me and I make no guarantee they work for you.
